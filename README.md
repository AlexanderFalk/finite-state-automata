# Finite State Automata
## Log file "Monitoring" with regular expression
## Created by : Alexander Falk
Assignment #4 for Discrete Mathematics.

A static log-file (Finite_log.txt) is being streamed into the program for analyzing. A regular expression is then made to group content from the logfile and int a Map of SystemIDs/UserIDs and Log-objects (which is a class in the program). 
  
The analyze with the REGEX of the logfile content is then put into another file called: **States.txt**. Here you will be able to see; which user is in what state and for how long.
